                      <p>
                        Hi! I'm Shivanshu Tiwari. I am student of Oriental College of
                        Technology. I was born and raised in Bhopal and have always been
                        interested in new technologies. Since childhood technologies hav been
                        facinating for me therefore I always wanted to be a software engineer.
                        And I looking to start the career as an entry-level software engineer
                        with a reputed firm driven by technology. I’ve been working on my
                        portfolio since high school, but now it’s time to show the world what
                        I’ve got. And that’s why I’ve created this website—so you can see my
                        work so far and get a sense of who I am as a developer.
